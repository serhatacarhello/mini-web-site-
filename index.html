                <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just
                    under 9 million.[1] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80
                    km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of
                    London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains
                    its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has
                    for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. For more <a href="#">click here</a>.

                <p>Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city of Italy. It is also the capital
                    of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune
                    di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most
                    populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city
                    limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most
                    populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within
                    Italy.[4] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio
                    (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an
                    independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country
                    within a city. For more <a href="#">click here</a>.</p>

                <p>Although the Financial District, Union Square, and Fisherman's Wharf are well known around the world,
                    San Francisco is also characterized by its numerous culturally rich streetscapes featuring mixed-use
                    neighborhoods anchored around central commercial corridors to which residents and visitors alike can
                    walk.The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) houses 20th century and contemporary works of
                    art. It moved to its current building in the South of Market neighborhood in 1995 and attracted more
                    than 600,000 visitors annually.[287] SFMOMA closed for renovation and expansion in 2013. The museum
                    reopened on May 14, 2016, with an addition, designed by Snøhetta, that has doubled the museum's
                    size. For more <a href="#">click here</a>.</p>
